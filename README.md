# faster_R-CNN
Faster R-CNN Project

**Progression**
* Implementation in Matlab
* Implementation in PyCafffee
* Implementation in Tensorflow

### Implementation in Matlab
1. Train a stop sign R-CNN detector from a pre-trained Cifar10 Network (MATLAB Example)
2. Use the detector to process a video
3. Train a faster R-CNN detector for vehicle detection (MATLAB Example)
4. Train a stop sign faster R-CNN detector (working on....)

### Implementation in PyCaffee
1. Forked from [rbgirshicck repo](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn) and finished build on Ubuntu 14.04

### Implementation in Tensorflow
(working on...)
